# Hackweek Regression Analysis Toolkit

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive regression analysis toolkit in R, focusing on real-world regression tasks using two legendary built-in datasets: `mtcars` and `iris`. The toolkit is designed for intermediate users looking to strengthen their data science and R programming skills.

## Features
- Multiple linear regression on `mtcars` and `iris`
- Polynomial regression for `mtcars`
- Interaction term analysis for `iris`
- Data exploration and visualization
- Diagnostic and residual plots
- Interpretation tips for regression output

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AMANSINGH1674/Hackweek-Regression.git
   cd Hackweek-Regression
   ```
2. **Open `regression_analysis.R` in RStudio** or run in the R terminal:
   ```r
   source("regression_analysis.R")
   ```
   Or from the command line:
   ```bash
   Rscript regression_analysis.R
   ```
3. **View the output:**
   - Console will display regression summaries and interpretation tips.
   - Plots will be shown in RStudio or saved to `Rplots.pdf` if run via command line.

## Dataset Information
- **mtcars:** Motor Trend Car Road Tests, includes fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 cars (1973â€“74 models).
- **iris:** Edgar Anderson's Iris Data, includes measurements of sepal length and width, petal length and width, for 150 iris flowers from three species.
